The sea is a luminous pane of silver. Holding the tiller of your sailing boat, you keep your gaze fixed on the glittering constellation known as the Spider. It marks the north, and by keeping it to port you know you are still on course.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe sun appears in a trembling burst of red fire at the rim of the world. Slowly the chill of night gives way to brazen warmth. You lick your parched lips. There is a little water sloshing in the bottom of the barrel by your feet, but not enough to see you through another day.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tSealed in a scroll case tucked into your jerkin is the parchment map your grandfather gave you on his death-bed. You remember his stirring tales of far sea voyages, of kingdoms beyond the western horizon, of sorcerous islands and ruined palaces filled with treasure. As a child you dreamed of nothing else but the magical quests that were in store if you too became an adventurer.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou never expected to die in an open boat before your adventures even began.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tSecuring the tiller, you unroll the map and study it again. You hardly need to. Every detail is etched into your memory by now. According to your reckoning, you should have reached the east coast of Harkuna, the great northern continent, days ago.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tA pasty grey blob splatters on to the map. After a moment of stunned surprise, you look up and curse the seagull circling directly overhead. Then it strikes you - where there&#8217;s a seagull, there may be land.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou leap to your feet and scan the horizon. Sure enough, a line of white cliffs lie a league to the north. Have you been sailing along the coast all this time without realising the mainland was so close?\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tSteering towards the cliffs, you feel the boat judder against rough waves. A howling wind whips plumes of spindrift across the sea. Breakers pound the high cliffs. The tiller is yanked out of your hands. The little boat is spun around, out of control, and goes plunging in towards the coast.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou leap clear at the last second. There is the snap of timber, the roaring crescendo of the waves - and then silence as you go under. Striking out wildly, you try to swim clear of the razor-sharp rocks. For a while the undertow threatens to drag you down, then suddenly a wave catches you and flings you contemptuously up on to the beach.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tBattered and bedraggled you lie gasping for breath until you hear someone walking along the shore towards you. Wary of danger, you lose no time in getting to your feet. Confronting you is an old man clad in a dirty loin-cloth. His eyes have a feverish bright look that is suggestive of either a mystic or a madman.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tNow <goto section=\"20\"/>.\r\n\t</p>\r\n</section>\r\n","10.xml":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<section name=\"10\" boxes=\"4\" image=\"10.jpg\">\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<if codeword=\"Assassin\">\r\n\t\t\tIf you have the codeword Assassin, <goto section=\"50\" force=\"f\"/> immediately.\r\n\t\t</if>\r\n\t\tIf not, read on.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<if not=\"t\" codeword=\"StillInYellowport\">\r\n\t\t\t<if not=\"t\" codeword=\"YellowportUprising\">\r\n\t\t\t<!-- temporarily remove the townhouse option -->\r\n\t\t\t<if codeword=\"1.10.1\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<set var=\"RestoreTownhouse\" value=\"1\"/>\r\n\t\t\t\t<lose codeword=\"1.10.1\" hidden=\"t\"/>\r\n\t\t\t</if>\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIf you have just arrived in Yellowport, <tick>tick the first empty box above</tick> (use a pencil).

From here, the mineral is exported all over Harkuna. Unfortunately, all that sulphur has its drawbacks. The stink is abominable, and much of the city has a yellowish hue. The river is so full of sulphur that it is virtually useless as a source of food or of drinking water. However, the demand for sulphur, especially from the sorcerous guilds, is great.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tPolitically, much has changed in the past few years.

The sea is a luminous pane of silver. Holding the tiller of your sailing boat, you keep your gaze fixed on the glittering constellation known as the Spider, the sign under which you were born. It marks the north, and by keeping it to port you know you are still on course.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThe sun appears in a trembling burst of red fire at the rim of the world.

There is a snap of timber, the roaring crescendo of the waves - and then silence as you go under. Striking out wildly, you try to swim clear of the razorsharp rocks.

You had signed on board a ship with the hope of visiting a dozen ports and seeing a thousand wonders. But calamity overtook your voyage in the first week, when pirates swooped down upon the vessel. You and a handful of shipmates managed to get the cutter down into the water and were making off, but some of the pirates leapt down from the rail right in your midst. The fighting was hard. You remember little of it now, but when it was over the boat was awash with blood and you were the only one left alive. Of your own ship and the pirates' craft there was no sign - the current had carried you out of sight of any living thing.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tBest not to think how you've survived since then. At the mercy of the wind and sea currents, you have been swept steadily westwards into regions completely unknown to you. Drinking-water has been your biggest problem - you've had to rely on rain, and there has been none for days. Your body is weak, your spirits low.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tThen, just as death seems ready to draw his boat alongside, you see something that kindles new hope: white clouds; birds turning high above; the grey hump of land on the horizon!\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tSteering towards the shore, you feel the cutter lurch as it enters rough water. The wind whips up plumes of spindrift and breakers pound the cliffs. The tiller is yanked out of your hands. The little boat is spun around, out of control, and goes plunging towards the coast.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou leap clear at the last second. There is the snap of timber, the roaring crescendo of the waves - and then silence as you go under. Striking out wildly, you try to swim clear, then suddenly a wave catches you and flings you contemptuously up on to the beach. You are battered, bedraggled, but alive.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p><goto section=\"539\">Turn to 539</goto>.</p>\r\n</section>\r\n","10.xml":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<section name=\"10\">\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tYou feel a momentary sense of absolute oblivion, and then you appear near a great city of disturbing design. <goto section=\"444\"/>.\r\n\t</p>\r\n</section>\r\n","100.xml":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<section name=\"100\">\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\t<if codeword=\"Drifter\">If you have the codeword Drifter <if codeword=\"Energy\">and the codeword Energy, <goto section=\"652\"/>.</if></if> Otherwise read on.\r\n\t</p>\r\n\t<p>\r\n\t\tKunrir is a sprawling port city on the west coast of Uttaku.
